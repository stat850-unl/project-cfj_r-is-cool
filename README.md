Football Data: This data was obtained from <https://kaggle.com>. It is a
website that grants free access to data on vast topics. The data
comprises of several variables that can be used for interesting analysis
in FIFA World Cup. The Fifa World Cup is the biggest stage in
international football, and the players that take part in it are some of
the best in the world. But what goes into making a great World Cup
player? Is it the wage of a player? Is it their individual ratings for
specific skillsets? Or something unrelated to the variables considered
in this dataset?

This dataset contains information on players overall ratings, as well as
their individual ratings for specific skillsets. This data can be used
to probe into so many aspects related to the World Cup and its players,
including anomaly detection for player ratings.


# 1.0 INTRODUCTION
Football is one of the most popular and followed sports in the world. Football is a team sport that involves 22 players (with 11 players from two teams) kicking a ball to score a goal. For each team, there is a goalkeeper whose purpose is to catch the ball (with his hand) or prevent the ball from entering the goalpost (by any means possible using any part of the body). The goalkeeper is the only player who is allowed to use the hand but only within the 18-yard box or the penalty box. Any foul committed against the attacking team in the penalty box is regarded as a Penalty. There are also the defenders that mainly play to prevent the ball from entering the goalpost. We also have midfielders that play a role as intermediaries that connect the ball between the defenders and the forwards. The forwards are known as the goal scores; due to their position on the field they usually stand a higher chance of scoring a goal. Depending on the role of the player, a midfielder may play as a defensive midfielder, central midfielder, attacking midfielder, and wide midfielder (also known as a winger)<sup>1</sup>. A team's ability to score a goal(s) in a match depends on the quality of attackers that they have (attackers here refers to both the forwards and attacking midfielders). Also, a team with a very strong defense stands a very low chance of conceding a goal(s). In both cases, a team with weak midfielders might face high attacking pressure from the opponent. 

There are many football competitions across the world, both at the club level and the national level. Among the numerous football competitions, the most popular and most anticipated of all is the FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA, the International Federation of Association Football), the sport's global governing body<sup>2</sup>. Since its inaugural tournament in 1930 hosted and won by Uruguay, the FIFA World Cup Championship has been held every four years, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held due to the second world war<sup>2</sup>. So far, as of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, twenty-one final tournaments have been held and a total of 79 national teams have participated^2. The trophy has been won by eight national teams. Brazil has won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.

The FIFA World Cup is the biggest stage of international football, and the players that take part in it are some of the bests in the world. But how does FIFA rate the players that participate in this championship? For football lovers, the FIFA rating is one of the most anticipated sides of the game. Every football fan wants to know how his/her favorite football player was rated. This, sometimes, results in a lot of criticism and questions on how FIFA's overall ratings are composed. Most importantly what it is composed of, and how much do these compositions each contribute to the overall rating of the players? In general, there are over 35 different statistics that are composed of the FIFA overall rating of players<sup>3</sup>. However, six of them (i.e., speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality) are notably known as they hold the greatest contributions<sup>3</sup>. The weighting given to these compositions is dependent on the player's team position (i.e., as a midfielder, defender, or forward). Also, the players' international reputation (IR; rated in stars, from one star to five stars) has been noted to add to the overall rating of the players (hereafter, OVR). There is another rating of players known as Weak Foot Skill (WFS) and Skill Moves (SM). Weak Foot Skill measures the ability of a player to shoot with one foot as he does with his preferred foot<sup>4</sup>. All players have a preferred foot (either the left foot or the right foot). Having a 5-star weak foot rating means that a player’s weaker foot shot is identical to their preferred foot shot. Having a 1-star weak foot rating means that the player can only shoot well with one foot<sup>4</sup>. Skill Moves measures the ability of a player to perform technical moves (also rated from one star to 5 stars). Another factor that is most likely to be overlooked is the players' workings rate. The player working rate considers the extent to which a player contributes to running and chasing in a match while not in possession of the ball<sup>5</sup>. This is categorized into attacking working rate (AWR) and defensive working rate (DWR). 
In this study, we sort to understand the OVR of FIFA World Cup players and its compositions. Specifically, we ask the following questions: 1. which of the six compositions (i.e., speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality) contributes largely to the OVR of the players? 2. Does the preferred foot, international reputation, weak foot skill, skill moves, and working rate of the players matter when it comes to the player's performance? 
The questions that are answered in questions (1) and (2) also lead us to pursue other interesting questions about the data such as Factors that contribute to the wage of a player who participated in the world cup. Statistical concepts like Multiple Linear Regression and ANOVA will be utilized.

# 2.0 METHODS
## 2.1 Data Description 
The data for this study was downloaded from Kaggle using this link,
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/fifa-world-cup-anomaly-detection-in-player-ratin?select=players_20.csv. The data is about FIFA World Cup players and their ratings. This data set contains detailed information related to the FIFA World Cup players, including information on players' overall ratings, as well as their individual ratings for specific skill sets. The data is made up of 18278 observations and 104 variables. Details on all variables can be found at the data download site. But for the purpose of this project, we will only focus on the following variables: 1. overall - The player's overall rating given on a percentage scale, 2. preferred foot - The player's preferred foot (either left foot or right foot), 3. international reputation - The player's international reputation rated on a scale of one to five, 4. weak foot - The player's weak foot rating on a scale of one to five, 5. skill moves - The player's skill moves rating on a scale of one to five, 6. working rate - this variable measures the working rate of the player on low, medium, and high scales. It is also measured based on attacking working rate vs defensive working rate, making a total of nine-factor levels (e.g., high/low = "high" attacking working rate and "low" defensive working rate), and 7. the six main compositions (i.e., speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending and physicality). Each of these compositions is an integer variable measured on a percentage scale. In total, out of the 104 variables, 12 variables are selected for our analysis. One (i.e., the overall) is the response variable, and the remaining 11 are the explanatory variables. For the explanatory variables, the players preferred foot and working rates are dummy/categorical variables. The players' international reputation, skill moves, and weak foot skills are rated in stars (i.e., from "1star" (lowest) to "5 stars" (highest)). In the data set, these star ratings were computed as integer variables but for the purpose of the analysis, we will treat them as factor variables with five levels (each level matching to a star; 1star, 2stars, 3stars, 4stars, and 5stars). The stars here can be seen as the unit of measuring these variables. The remaining six explanatory variables are the players' speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality ratings; all rated on a percentage scale and computed as integers in the data set. 

## 2.2 Analysis
### 2.2.1 Which of the six compositions contributes largely to the OVR of the players?
We used random forest regression (Breiman et al. 2001) to model the relationships between overall ratings and the speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality of the players. Random forest regression is a collection of tree-structured weak learners comprised of identically distributed random vectors where each tree contributes to a prediction for the response variable (here, overall rating) (Breiman et al. 2001). Random forest regression is modeled using a set of weak learners generated based on a bootstrap of the data that helps improve the algorithm's convergence to reach an optimal solution (Evans et al. 2011). This technique makes random forest regression insensitive to data distribution and robust to noise even given a very large number of independent variables with potential multicollinearity. It is also robust to overfitting, making it extremely useful for prediction (Prasad et al. 2006; Segal 2004). The main purpose of this analysis was to determine the variable importance for explaining the overall rating of the FIFA World Cup players based on the player's speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality. This will be visualized based on the node of purity, which measures the overall contribution of the component factors. The higher the node of purity, the greater the contribution. In this study, the Random Forest model was built using the Random Forest package ver 4.7 available in R 4.1.2 (R Development Core Team 2022).

### 2.2.2 Does the preferred foot, international reputation, weak foot skill, skill moves, and working rate of the players matter when it comes to player's performance? 
We will evaluate this using the ggbetweenstats function from the ggstatsplots (an extension of the ggplot2 package) package in R core team ver 4.1.2. The ggstatsplots package produces an elegant violin-box plot with statistical annotations to explore if there is any significant difference in the contribution of the players' preferred foot, international reputation, weak foot skill and skill moves on the overall FIFA ratings of the players. Here, we will make a separate violin-box plot for each of the following explanatory variables (all treated as categorical or factor variables): preferred foot, international reputation, weak foot skill, skill moves, and working rate. The OVR of the players is the response variable. 

### 2.2.3 What factors contribute to the wage of a player who participated in the world cup?
We performed a multiple linear regression to determine factors that contribute to the wage or salary of a player who participated in the world cup. The assumptions required for this analysis was taken into consideration, i.e, Normality and Independence.  These assumptions were verified by first making correlation plots(correlation pairs) to determine which variables are correlated with one another, especially with the response variables Wage_eur. The variables that had higher correlation coefficients were selected for the regression model. After deriving the model, we also made residual plots to check the normality assumption. The first residual plots we made showed that the data violated the assumptions for the simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Therefore, we made a transformation on the data by using the log to the base ten function and also the square root function. The variables used to develop the model were International Reputation, Overall player rating, Passing, Dribbling and Wage. The wage of a player was the response variable and  International Reputation, Overall player rating, Passing, Dribbling served as our explanatory variable.

The distribution of the age was identified to be normally distributed . This is shown by a histogram plot included in the picture below. Also, correlation pairs are plotted to determine the strength of association between all pairs of variables.
